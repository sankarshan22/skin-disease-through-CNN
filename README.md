The identification of skin diseases is crucial in dermatology, healthcare, and early diagnosis.
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model for automatic
classification of skin diseases using image data. Unlike conventional manual diagnosis methods,
which are time-consuming and prone to human error, deep learning offers an efficient and accurate
alternative.
The dataset consists of images of various skin conditions, which are preprocessed and used
to train a CNN model from scratch. The model extracts key features from skin images, enabling
precise classification. Performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy and precision are used to
assess the model's effectiveness.
The implementation avoids high-level deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch,
focusing instead on a fundamental approach using NumPy and custom backpropagation. This
project contributes to the field of medical image recognition and can serve as a foundation for
mobile or web-based dermatology applications.
The CNN architecture is designed to extract intricate patterns and features from skin images,
such as texture, color variations, and lesion structure, enabling robust classification. One of the
major contributions is the inclusion of techniques such as data augmentation and normalization to
handle variations in image quality and ensure model generalizability. The system is evaluated using
performance metrics like accuracy, achieving competitive results across multiple disease categories.
This could revolutionize traditional skin disease diagnosis by providing an automated,
efficient, and scalable solution. Further, the application can be extended to assist dermatologists,
researchers, and healthcare practitioners in identifying skin conditions quickly and accurately.
Future work involves integrating the model into a user-friendly web or mobile application, making
it accessible for medical professionals and patients while exploring the inclusion of additional skin
diseases and real-time image recognition capabilitie
